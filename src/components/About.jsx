        I am a fullstack web developer with a year of experience. I graduated
        from Government College of Engineering, Aurangabad, with a degree in
        Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering.
        <br />
        Along my career path, I worked as a Webflow developer where I gained
        valuable experience in building no code websites. Later, to enhance my
        Web Development skills, I started learning through online resources like
        The Odin Project and interned at Almabetter. I'm currently working as a
        fullstack developer at Bonds India.
        <br />
        As a result, I have gained expertise in front-end technologies like
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React as well as back-end technologies like
        Node.js and MongoDB.
        <br />
        I'm always keen to learn and implement new technologies to create
        efficient and elegant web solutions. I also am a gaming content creator
        on Youtube.
